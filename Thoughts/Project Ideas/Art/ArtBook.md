Using the projects in mono/art dir, turn each into pdf page.

Need to:
	clean up each project and determine if its worth keeping. 
	add <meta> data to each like title, description
	add custom elements to parse into blocks of text in the pdf

Consider designing each page:
	in HTML/CSS, then exporting the full page
	using something like Adobe InDesigner or Scribus

If an artwork changes over time add multiple snapshots


Extend this to all your art.
	Scan your physical art and include it in this book
