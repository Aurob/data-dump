- Ways to Generate Symmetrical Patterns
	- Translation
		- Primary cell is moved sideways, vertically, or diagonally
	- Rotation
		- Primary cell is rotated a certain number of times
			- equilateral triangle rotated six times makes a hexagon
			- square tile rotated 4 times makes a square
			- diamond 3 times makes a hexagon
			- rectangle 2 times makes a square
	- Mirror (Reflection)
		- Primary cell is moved and flipped
			- Vertical or horizontal
	- Glide (Glide Reflection)
		- Combination of translation and mirror
		- Horizontal, Vertical, and Diagonal
