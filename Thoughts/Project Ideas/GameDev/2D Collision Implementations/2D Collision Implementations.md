Detecting collisions between objects in a naive way, by checking every object against every other object, can be extremely inefficient, especially in a very large space with potentially thousands of objects. This method has a complexity of O(n^2), which means that the time it takes to compute collisions grows quadratically with the number of objects.

However, using spatial partitioning techniques can greatly improve performance. Here are a couple of standard techniques used in collision detection that can help:

1. **Quadtree (or Octree in 3D)**: This data structure partitions the space into hierarchical nodes. Each node represents a smaller section of the space and only contains references to objects within its bounds. Collision checks are then only performed between objects that are in the same or neighboring nodes. Larger objects might span several nodes and would thus be checked against objects in each of those nodes, but the overall number of checks is still greatly reduced.
2. **Spatial Hashing**: Objects are assigned to cells in a grid based on their position. Collision detection is then performed between objects that occupy the same cell or neighboring cells. With spatial hashing, larger objects might occupy multiple cells, which needs to be accounted for but similarly reduces the number of checks required significantly.
3. **Sweep and Prune (or Sort and Sweep)**: In this axis-based technique, the idea is to project all objects onto a chosen axis and sort them based on their starting point along that axis. By comparing neighbouring objects in this sorted list, potential collisions are quickly identified without having to check objects that are far apart.
4. **Bounding Volumes**: Before testing for precise collisions between two complex objects, it's often faster to first check if their simple bounding volumes (like rectangles, circles, or spheres) intersect. This is a sort of "broad-phase" collision detection that helps to eliminate a majority of unnecessary detailed checks.

By implementing one or a combination of these strategies, larger objects have optimized collision checks which will reduce processing time, but the actual optimization usually isn't specifically about the size of the objects but rather about how many objects can potentially collide with a given object and minimizing the number of collision checks performed.

This efficiency gain will be most pronounced when the scene has a lot of objects. With fewer objects, the overhead of the data structure might outweigh its benefits. However, given a 10000x10000 canvas, the optimization potential is significant and can greatly improve performance.
