Thinking about how to create procedural content in a game with NPC’s

One idea is to implement “rituals”, could be religous/spiritual like going to an altar and praying, or could even be something like leaving flowers on a grave, a dog spinning before laying down, a cat at its favorite scratching post, etc..
