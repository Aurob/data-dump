Right now in my game, an entity is given a position, a shape, and optionally, a type. If no entity type is given, the entity will be rendered as a simple rectangle.

If a type is specified, the entity will have a custom render step where multiple rectangles based on the original entity shape will be used to render a full shape.

A flower, for example:

![[flower.png]]

In the event that I need to render 100s or 1000s of these flowers, I have to re-draw every single one.

What I should be doing is drawing a single flower and writing it to a texture, then rendering that texture. This will be an absolute must if Iâ€™m going to keep adding different entity types with custom rendering

In SDL, drawing operations that involve primitive shapes like rectangles, circles, and lines are generally CPU-intensive because they involve rendering calculations for each frame. When you have a lot of these primitives to draw (like your 1000 butterflies), this can quickly become a performance bottleneck, depending on your CPU's capability and the complexity of each shape.

On the other hand, drawing from a texture is typically much faster. This is because the graphic data is stored in the GPU memory and can be quickly accessed and drawn to the screen without the need for recalculating the shape's pixels each time. This process is generally referred to as "blitting" and is hardware-accelerated by the GPU.

To optimize the drawing of your butterflies, what you can do is draw one butterfly to an off-screen surface or texture first, and then reuse that texture to draw all the other butterflies. This technique is similar to creating a sprite except that you are generating it at runtime.

Here's a basic conceptual outline of the procedure you would follow using SDL:

1. Create a new, empty SDL_Texture or SDL_Surface that will serve as your off-screen canvas (also referred to as a "render target" if you're using an SDL_Renderer).
2. Set this as your render target using `SDL_SetRenderTarget()` (if using an SDL_Renderer).
3. Draw your butterfly shapes (rects, lines for the antenna, etc.) onto this off-screen texture or surface just once.
4. Reset the render target back to the default target with `SDL_SetRenderTarget()` if necessary.
5. Use `SDL_RenderCopy()` or equivalent function to draw this texture onto the screen multiple times wherever you need a butterfly.
