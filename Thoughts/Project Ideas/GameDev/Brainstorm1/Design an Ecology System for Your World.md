I can add proximity-based events for all entities. It would be an extension of collisions; check for any colliding entities in a radius n*entity_radius where n is a distance in world units.

  

Different effects can be applied to entities based on what entities are within their proximity.

For example:

Here are some examples of proximity-based events:

1. Predators hunting prey: When a predator comes within a certain radius of a prey entity, it initiates a hunting behavior, chasing and attacking the prey.
2. Symbiotic relationships: Some entities may form mutually beneficial relationships when they are in proximity. For example, cleaner fish and larger fish can form a symbiotic relationship where the cleaner fish remove parasites from the larger fish's body.
3. [[Mutualistic interactions]]: Mutualistic interactions are partnerships in nature where both participants benefit, such as cleaner fish eating parasites off other fish or bees pollinating flowers while gathering nectar.
