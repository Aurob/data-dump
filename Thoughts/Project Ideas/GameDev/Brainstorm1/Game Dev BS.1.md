  

I’m at an impasse on what to work on next for my game project. Should I continue refining existing mechanics or begin working on more complex features? Commit to a narrative or try something more dynamic? Any additions I make only add to the complexity which only makes me want to further refine before adding more.

I wrote a simple description of my game direction and fed it into GPT-4 through the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)

A general overview of current capabilities of my game:

- Top-Down 2D tile-based world. Proceduraly generated, effectively infinite, and near-infinite zoom "in & out" (make tiles bigger/smaller).
- Basic 2D physics
- Buildings with seamless entering/exiting
- Cross-platform functionality with WASM and Emscripten
- Important Libs: Entt, ImGui, FastNoise, Json
- JSON Config that can be loaded in the browser and sent to C++ at runtime to build out a world with entities

Because of the entity system with EnTT, it is actually very easy to create new, and often complex, ideas in this engine.

  
The issue is that creating anything is a time commitment and a potential source of tech debt. So I try to think of mechanics and features that are as general as possible; These new features should be applicable to multiple unrelated concepts.  

Example: collision detection allows for the feature of objects colliding and reacting due to physics, but it also allows for determining if a player is inside a building by checking if the player is colliding with the building.

  

Creating a huge detailed story is not manageable, due to how large the world is. I could of course limit the range a player can go in the world, but I think that essentially neuters my game's potential.  
I'm thinking that due to serendipitous discoveries, building up slowly and deliberately will naturally fill the world up in a more cohesive way than planning it all in advance ever could. It will also allow me to optimize, refine, and refactor for times when the ideas are slow-going.  

Output From GPT-4-Turbo:

Given the flexibility of your game engine and the desire to focus on developing general features that enable a wide array of gameplay experiences, here's a revised list that aligns with your approach to game creation:

[[Create a Dynamic Quest Generation System]]

[[Design an Ecology System for Your World]]

[[Implement Procedural Lore Elements]]

[[Character Background Perks]]

[[Natural Language Processing for Dialogues]]

[[Dynamic Event System]]

[[Multi-layered Faction AI]]

[[Player Influence on the Environment]]

[[Modular Quest Components]]

[[Simple Story Seeds]]

Each of these features should be built with an eye toward modularity and scalability so that they can evolve with the game world. **By focusing on systems that create emergent gameplay and stories, you can build a living world without the need to script vast amounts of content manually**. This approach echoes what you've described and should make for an engaging and diverse gaming experience that capitalizes on the game world's procedural nature.
