These are all religious or mythological concepts representing intermediate or transitional realms between life and death, or temporary states of existence after death. They generally share some common characteristics:

They are neither the ultimate paradise/heaven nor the deepest hell in their respective belief systems
Many of them are described as places where souls undergo some form of transition, judgment, or purification
Most of these realms are often depicted as somewhat gloomy or neutral spaces rather than places of extreme punishment or reward
In many cases, these realms serve as waiting areas where souls reside temporarily before moving on to their final destination
