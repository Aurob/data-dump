Have the player traverse a distance only to find a roadblock and have to turn back, revealing a new plot point along the way back
Playing a game now where there are a lot of objects in the world that server no purpose but can be interacted with
 - specifically I can left mouse click on a book and "pick it up" and right click and it will be thrown ahead of me some ways
Pressing or interacting with buttons/levers/other so that a door/portal/entrance opens up
Something that follows the movement of the player but does not interact
left click global interact, right click interact with interacted from left.
 - particurly with transitions between spaces
