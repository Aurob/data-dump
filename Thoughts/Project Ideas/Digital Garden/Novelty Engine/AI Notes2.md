1. Activity Theory
Originating from cultural-historical psychology, Activity Theory explores how tools, community, and objects mediate human actions. Applying this lens could reveal how users interact with an aggregator to accomplish real tasks, how their goals evolve over time, and how the aggregator itself influences those goals.

2. Distributed Cognition
This framework studies cognition as a systemic process distributed across people, artifacts, and the environment. Investigating how knowledge is “held” both in human minds and in your aggregator’s file system can inspire features that better support group collaboration, handoffs, or asynchronous knowledge building.

3. Boundary Objects
Drawn from sociology and science studies, Boundary Objects are artifacts flexible enough to be interpreted differently by various communities but robust enough to maintain identity across these interpretations. Your aggregator’s notes or artifacts could function as boundary objects among different collaborators or across distinct projects.

4. Actor-Network Theory (ANT)
A sociological approach that treats humans and nonhumans (e.g., software, notes, scripts) as equally important actors in a network. ANT might guide the design of your aggregator by emphasizing how various “actors” (people, files, algorithms) continually negotiate the system’s structure and use-cases.

5. Cognitive Load Theory
Explores how human working memory handles complexity. Applying Cognitive Load Theory can help you identify where your aggregator might overwhelm users with too many simultaneous notes or references—and how to design for just the right amount of visible information at a time.

6. Wabi-Sabi Aesthetics
Rooted in Japanese philosophy, Wabi-Sabi embraces impermanence, imperfection, and the incomplete. Thinking in these terms might push you to design an aggregator that intentionally tolerates “messy” or “unfinished” states, encouraging iterative refinement rather than forcing perfect organization.

7. Requisite Variety (from Cybernetics)
This principle states that a system needs as much internal diversity as the diversity of the environment it faces. Translating this to your aggregator means ensuring it can handle a wide variety of content (e.g., code, PDFs, notes, data streams) without choking on unexpected formats or evolving user needs.

8. Paradox of Choice
Social psychologists note that too many options or branches can paralyze decision-making. In your aggregator, you might consider how to present just enough pathways (e.g., relevant file links, prompts) without creating a dizzying array of choices that reduces productivity or enjoyment.

9. Wayfinding in Information Spaces
Adapted from architecture and navigation, Wayfinding in digital environments focuses on how users orient themselves, choose paths, and recognize landmarks. Incorporating wayfinding principles could shape folder hierarchies, naming conventions, or search tools that help users “navigate” the aggregator more intuitively.

10. Symmathesy
Coined by Nora Bateson, Symmathesy refers to mutual learning in living systems. Your aggregator can be treated as a “learning context” where every part (user, data, code scripts, AI modules) adapts and evolves based on interactions with the other parts, leading to a more holistic system design.

Why These Concepts Matter
Adaptability: Ideas like Requisite Variety or Symmathesy encourage a system flexible enough to adapt to evolving user needs and content types.
User-Centric Balance: Cognitive Load Theory and the Paradox of Choice offer ways to minimize overwhelm, ensuring your aggregator remains a helpful companion rather than a cognitive burden.
Sociotechnical Insight: Activity Theory, Distributed Cognition, and Actor-Network Theory examine how users, tools, and contexts shape each other. This can deepen your understanding of how people actually use (and misuse) the aggregator.
Aesthetic & Philosophical Dimensions: Wabi-Sabi aesthetics highlight the value of unfinished, evolving states, pushing for less rigid organization. Boundary Objects remind us that different teams or projects might interpret the same data in unique ways.
These new concepts are offered as jump-off points—terms and frameworks you might wish to research further, experimenting with how they inform your aggregator’s design philosophy, user workflows, and potential expansions.

In building a next-generation aggregator that balances collaboration and personal exploration, you can draw on Activity Theory to keep tasks fluid and user-centered, invoke Boundary Objects to unify multiple contexts, integrate Actor-Network Theory to treat both humans and nonhumans as vital actors, employ Cognitive Load Theory to prevent overwhelm, and embed Wabi-Sabi principles for embracing imperfection. Coupling insights from the Paradox of Choice to avoid decision fatigue, Wayfinding in Information Spaces to aid orientation, and Symmathesy to foster iterative learning and interconnection, you can create a more seamless knowledge ecosystem that sparks serendipity and deeper engagement. As you refine and expand your project further, you might also explore Information Foraging Theory (examining how users “hunt” for data in complex environments), Affordance-Based Design (highlighting intuitive, direct interactions in tool interfaces), and Epistemic Actions research (understanding how external structures or gestures extend cognitive capacity).
