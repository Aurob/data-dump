I accumulate data on the following:
 - browsers
  - mobile
  - laptop
  - desktop
I routinely copy all open tabs or book marks and paste into cloud locations, 
 manual action should be used to model automation
Behavior of interaction with browsers should focus design on custom interface
interoperability is ideal, but resillience is neccessary
