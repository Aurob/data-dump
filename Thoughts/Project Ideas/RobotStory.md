I have a fairly robust topdown 2d game engine made with SDL2, enTT, a basic physics engine, WEBGL shaders for textures and procedural terrain generation, a json parser, compiled to WASM, and a lot of front-end JS/HTML to support; I can do JS-C and C-JS freely.

I have a good config system where I can define entities with all the components I need. I fetch this from js and parse it and pass to C which processes and converts to entities and renders them with the shaders. 
What really needs to improve is how I essentially place characters and have them act out things. I have prototypes of entities pathfinding to another entity after some other entity interacted with another entity.
Essentially I think I know how I can make detailed, complex narratives. The hardest part will of course be the programmatic binds I encounter.

The player inhabits a robot created by a hermit/creator/master/god. The game opens with the robot in the bed of a pickup truck driven by the creator through country roads; it's daytime, and the robot is recharging. The creator is relocating to a new parcel of land and wakes the robot with the line: “Watch, you’ll want to remember this area.” A bird’s-eye view of the land is shown. There is a small, reclusive dwelling, with implications of larger plans. Initially, the player experiences a scenic intro guided by the creator. Once on the property, the player gains full control of the robot. Exiting the parcel triggers containment mechanics. The first act is exploration, optionally completed before the creator assigns chores. The next act begins when 50–75% of the parcel is explored.
	
Is considering an alternative intro where the robot’s origin is unclear but more dramatic: it is tossed onto muddy ground during a rainy night, damaged and unable to recharge. It rests until sunrise, then begins rebooting. The hermit appears and physically moves the robot, initiating their relationship. Dense worldbuilding begins from this point.
	
Game narrative centers on a robot created by a human to perform tasks; the gameplay involves the robot carrying out the human's directives. The narrative focus, at this stage, is meditative rather than lore-driven. The setting is a rural homestead in the year 2074 (contextually). The player is a robot created by a hermit—an eccentric, self-sufficient inventor who lives off the land. This hermit creates robots not out of necessity, but as an artistic endeavor. Over time, earlier automations fell into disrepair due to waning interest. The hermit becomes aware that his presence will persist after death and that its state could affect others. Though annoyed by this neurotic foresight, he sees engineering as a way to fill time and explore uncertain potential, despite always returning to a state of complacent acceptance. His projects become the primary constant in his life. The robot the player inhabits is not a continuous character but a representation of the hermit’s evolving inventions—each instance reflecting the current state of his art.
	
The creator of the robot in the user's game narrative is a hermit—an eccentric, self-sufficient inventor who lives off the land. He creates robots not out of necessity, but as an artistic endeavor.

Game mechanics are contextualized through 'chores' assigned by the hermit—tasks a robot might be designed to perform, from simple actions to predictive behaviors based on human agency. The core narrative and game feel are driven by the hermit's presence. The hermit will eventually die in the narrative; the death could be slow (from illness) or fast and intense (potentially with intrigue), but the player's experience is always through something invented, not human or animal.
	
Is considering a narrative/mechanical path where the player (the robot) attempts to reach the hermit's family to take over the property. This path could have multiple branching options and contribute to the overall narrative flexibility.
	
The player's approach in the game will not be driven toward a specific goal; the hermit's death is inevitable, but the circumstances surrounding it can vary. In some cases, the death could even act as an easter egg or an actual game ender.
	
Early-game chores reflect the evolving capabilities of the hermit's inventions. The quirks in these expectations drive the game's sense of life and intrigue. Over time, as the hermit refines their work, the robot may eventually surpass the hermit—unless the hermit dies before that point.
	
Draws inspiration for their narrative from: *City* by Clifford Simak, especially the theme of intelligent beings (like dogs) debating human history; the *Halo* lore, particularly the Precursors’ creation of the Flood as a misguided attempt to preserve life; and Iain M. Banks' *The Culture*, which the user sees as a vision of perfection with a traceable origin, later normalized as a birthright in the galactic context.

Improved Game Narrative and Gameplay Outline
Core Context:

    Year: AD 2074
    Setting: A secluded rural homestead, deeply overgrown, partially reclaimed by nature. Quiet streams, dense forest edges, small clearings.
    Tone: Meditative, reflective, intimately explorative, subtle sci-fi layering.
    Creator: Human hermit—eccentric, visionary, deliberate in isolation. Artistic inventor, practical philosopher in the Socratic tradition, capable of advanced technological creation: robotics, autonomous machinery, and subtle biotech.
    Robot (player): Purpose-built automaton, following human instruction initially and evolving toward its own interpretations through gameplay.

Narrative Starts (Intros):

You have two rich intros that shape initial dynamics. Let's refine clarity, pacing, and narrative importance to each:
Intro Option #1: ("Arrival by Pickup Truck")

Scene opens with the sounds of tires scrunching along a dirt road, birds chirping, quiet ambience.

    Perspective: Screen is initially dark as the robot rests and charges; subtle sounds like muffled voices, engine humming and nature can be heard.

    Awakening Moment: Gentle resonance builds in audio. The Creator's voice clear:

        "Hey—wake up. You'll want to remember this area."
        Visual clarity fades in, blurred at first; view gently rises from laying flat, shaking with the truck's suspension. The player senses surroundings.

    Birds-Eye Cut: Smooth camera movement floats above vehicle, revealing:
        The parcel of land, dense natural borders, old fencing reclaimed by brush.
        A compact residence—partially covered in vines, solar arrays, evidence of the hermit’s minimalistic presence interspersed throughout; clearly, though modest, thoroughly inhabitable.

    Gameplay Transition:
    Truck pulls onto land and engine quiets.
    Creator steps out, moves around gently, checking limbs and wiring with warmth and care, dialogue softly reassuring—establishing clear parental dynamics.
    Player gains control once placed down. Creator gives subtle prompts toward exploration, but no demand yet placed on player actions. Exploration gently encouraged by creator’s gestures and subtle movements, player moves freely within clear bounds.

    Boundary:
    Invisible soft boundary triggers mechanically justified warnings (Clear, minimalist HUD warning signals from the creator's tech wrist module or sensor). Attempts to leave area lead to gentle redirection dialogues like:

        “Not ready for that yet. Come, let's finish up here first.”

Intro Option #2 ("Rainy Night Discovery") [Darker Initial Tone]:

Scene opens in thick darkness, steady rain. Auditory sensations—pelting rain hitting metal surface, muffled mechanical error beeping quietly, distant thunder.

    Perspective:
    Low viewpoint, shaking and flickering HUD overlay indicates damage, partial dysfunction. No available charging, low battery prompt apparent. Visual distortion effects blend seamlessly with narrative tones.

    Dramatic Movement:
    Audio indicates creator's approach—boots squelching mud, movement sounds cautious but deliberate.
    Robot is lifted, camera shifts upward slowly; flashes of creator visible through rain and distortion. Creator expression thoughtful but obscured, deeply interested rather than alarmed.

    Gameplay Transition:
    Fade-in from damage/low-power cue to peaceful internal boot-up diagnostics screen as sunlight slowly recharges robot. Stable visuals fade in gradually.
    Robot finds itself sheltered partially. Creator working quietly nearby, passive observation.
    Player regains minimal control, incentivized first by recharging module tutorial, internal diagnostics screen, basic limb-testing movements. First clear mission: Move toward creator to initiate contact, beginning narrative flow.

    Boundary:
    Similar subtle justifications mechanically in place—failing modules due to incomplete repairs, partial functionality, or protective warnings from creator. Boundary understood narratively and mechanically consistent, yet unobtrusive.

Core Gameplay Mechanics (Chores):

Centralized clear mechanics, with systemic flexibility:
Chores as Core Functionality:

    Chores are narrative quests issued by creator character.
    Chores clearly issued by speech or environmental context; follow guidelines defined both mechanically and narratively.
    Chores contextualized logically around maintenance, homestead improvement, artistic whimsy projects, resource collection, environmental observation, farming management, and inventor’s esoteric experiments.
    Inventor draws clear satisfaction from success; gently accommodates failures without explicitly punishing the player, but notes variations meaningfully.

Task Categories:

Primary Chores (Narrative Progression):

    One-off deeply narrative tasks; complex directives.
    Clearly drive story forward in subtle ways
    Always accompanied by clear, significant narrative interactions, dialed dialogue, and rewards or upgrades contextually given by creator.

Examples:

    “Locate & repair the irrigation pipes on the south garden” (introduces homestead logistics system).
    “Test the new sensor array and record wildlife movements near the eastern pond” (expands lore visibility, introduces fauna tracking tools).
    "Follow me—I need to show you how to manage the solar harvesters" (unlocks sustainable energy and modular resource management).

Repeatable Chores ("Dailies"):

    Simple tasks ensuring functional maintenance of the setting.
    Contextually intuitive, well-labeled, repeatable routines expected of a homestead robot.
    Reward integrated subtly—creator quiet commendation or electric/mechanical integrity perks.

Examples:

    Check solar array integrity each morning, clear debris.
    Water greenhouse plants systematically.
    Gather firewood and stack neatly near shed.

Upgrade & Repair Mechanics:

Narrative-supported thematic integration rather than arbitrary skill trees or abstracted leveling:

    Repairs/upgrades given by creator as direct response to tasks or environmental interactions/situations. Each narrative element is supported logically and presented meaningfully.
    Inventor periodically tinkers on player, narratively expanding functionality as engineer’s skill/interest shifts.
    Damage, maintenance, evolution dramatically contextual and clearly illustrated to the player.
    Chosen mechanical improvements subtly implied to reflect inventor’s evolving interests/philosophy; e.g., increased senses after a storm to "notice the unseen," strength improved after clear narrative physical tasks, communication/web-connection based on inventor's sentiments toward externalities.

Interaction & Exploration Design:

    Player autonomy to explore and define pace.
    Creator dynamically reacts naturally based on player decisions at configurable narrative checkpoints using simple but effective JSON scripting/interactions (“if chore_completed: event/dialogue X trigger”).
    Config-based scenario logic (simple JSON markup):

[
  {
    "chore_id": "solar_array_01",
    "description": "Inspect and clean solar panels.",
    "prerequisite": "none",
    "result": "dialogue_creator_pleased, power_systems_efficiency++"
  },
  {
    "chore_id": "irrigation_fix",
    "description": "Repair irrigation lines at south garden",
    "prerequisite": "exploration_south_garden >= 1",
    "result": "water_distribution_enabled, unlock_dialogue_creator_irrigation_thanks, player_tools_upgrade"
  }
]

Narrative Flexibility and Extensibility:

    Creator’s eventual or potential death is narratively embedded but not forced: deep branching scenarios support both successful and bittersweet gameplay paths.
    Modular JSON scenario authoring allows robust narrative layering—integrating emotional narrative points, random-chance interruptions, and player-choice sequences naturally.

Visual & Ambiance Cohesion:

    A muted, natural rural color palette augmented gently by technological elements—subtle glowing indicators, minimalist HUD.
    Soundscape layers of weather cycles, wildlife states, punctuated softly by occasional electronic ambience accentuating tech's delicate presence.

Conclusion (Practical Considerations):

    Clear distinction between primary narrative tasks and routine chores structurally gives players choice each day.
    JSON config script clearly defines chore states and narrative triggers allowing easy, non-hardcoded iteration on narrative scene iteration.
    Narrative grows dynamically around seemingly subtle, yet interwoven chores, driving deep player attachment and narrative significance organically.

This refined outline ensures strong thematic clarity, simpler technical integration, readily expandable narrative interactions, and inherent player-driven flexibility.
