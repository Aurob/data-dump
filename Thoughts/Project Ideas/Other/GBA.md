Develop a retro nostalgic style gameboy advaned game or artwork. first "phase: is just a portfolio. my name, title and a generative backsplash to wow the user. Phase 2 is making multiple generative artworks which will be accessable via a menu.
Features are meant to be just like any other webpage, I use the js canvas for like 90% of all my art projects, with the other 10% being a C++/SDL/WASM/Canvas approach and I will approach gba development with the same mental configuration I apprach with a typical x/y 2d plane etc.
performance doesn't matter.
it has no selling points and will not stand out, I am creating lost media.
Time will drive the Generative aspect by default. Interaction may follow
Technical hurldes aside ,there's always a first step. Absolute first goal is to output hello world to the screen with no user interaction.
It will never be 508 compliant.
Inspiration comes from developing a basic topdown open world proceduraly generated game with C++/SDL/Emscripten, originally made in a simpler form entirely in JS, I've also written it in SFML. So long term vision comes from the fact that I just know this "game" or "engine" will work regardless of language and platform, there is a "configuration space" of implementability and I think gba dev is in that scope. that's like phase 100 tho.
