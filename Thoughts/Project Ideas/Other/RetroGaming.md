Look into game development for a retro video game console like nintendo 64 or gameboy

Libraries exist for modern development for a variety of platforms
N64: https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon
GBA+: https://devkitpro.org/

Develop on an emulator, but use a flash cartridge to test on a real device.
