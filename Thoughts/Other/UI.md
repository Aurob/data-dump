Design an unconventional interface. Something like a mind-map where I can relate notes together, but still display them chaotically, where notes are linked by some thread, but the order overall is noisy.

Notes without any connections will simply float around.

Make the display of the note node depend on a number of factors, like size, created, updated, keywords, etcâ€¦
