Non-hegemonic conditions challenge or exist outside of the dominant social, cultural, political, or ideological norms and power structures. These can include subcultures, countercultures, or social practices that resist or operate independently from the prevailing authority or mainstream society's values. In these spaces or under these conditions, alternative narratives and forms of social order can emerge and thrive away from mainstream hegemony.

  

Non-hegemonic conditions refer to social, cultural, or political circumstances not dominated by prevailing mainstream norms or powers. They often foster alternative, counter-culture, or subaltern perspectives challenging dominant ideologies. These can include minority language preservation, indigenism, or subcultural art movements like street art as legitimate fine art, which resist mainstream artistic standards. These conditions often incubate innovation by providing platforms for voices marginalized by the hegemony.
