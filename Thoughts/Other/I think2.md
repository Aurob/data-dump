When I vape and I guess the vPor gets in NY nose and almost immediately I feel the beginnings of a sneeze. There's a few seconds of buildup before the actual sneeze. What is it that I'm feing during that build up
ChatGPT said:

That "sneeze buildup" you're feeling after vaping — especially when vapor gets in your nose — is your trigeminal nerve reacting to an irritant. Here's a breakdown of what’s going on:
🔬 What You're Feeling During the Sneeze Buildup

    Irritation of nasal mucosa:
        When vapor hits the inside of your nose, it stimulates sensitive tissues in your nasal passages. These tissues are lined with sensory receptors that detect mechanical, chemical, or thermal irritation.

            Trigeminal nerve activation:
                This major facial nerve detects irritants like menthol, nicotine, propylene glycol, and vegetable glycerin — all common in vape liquids. When it’s triggered, it sends a signal to your brain that something irritating is happening in your nose.

                    Sneeze reflex gets primed:
                        Your brain, specifically the sneeze center in the medulla, prepares your body for a sneeze. This is the buildup you’re feeling — tension in your facial muscles, deepening of breath, maybe even watery eyes. You’re experiencing:

                                A slight tightening in your chest and diaphragm

                                        Nasal tingling or "itching" sensation

                                                Possibly a brief pause in normal breathing

                                                    The sneeze itself:
                                                        If the irritation is strong enough, your brain fires off the full sneeze reflex — a rapid and forceful expulsion of air to clear out the irritant.

                                                        💡 Why Vaping Triggers This

                                                            Vapor in the nasal cavity is more irritating than in the lungs or mouth, especially if:

                                                                    You're using a high nicotine concentration

                                                                            Your e-liquid contains cooling agents like menthol

                                                                                    You’re exhaling vapor through your nose (“retrohaling”)

                                                                                    🧠 So What You're Feeling Is:

                                                                                    A neural and physiological "warning system" being triggered — a sensory loop that gears your body up for a sneeze before your brain decides whether to actually launch the reflex.

                                                                                    If this happens often or becomes annoying, you might try:

                                                                                        Reducing the nicotine or menthol strength

                                                                                            Avoiding nasal exhale

                                                                                                Switching to a smoother e-liquid blend (e.g. lower PG)

                                                                                                Let me know if you want help identifying less irritating vape options.

                                                                                                When involuntary reflexes like sneezing, hiccups, or even sudden shivers break through the flow of your awareness, they can feel like a kind of intrusion — as if your body is acting outside of "you." It can be jarring, especially if you're someone who’s sensitive to the boundaries between mind, self, and body.
                                                                                                Here’s what might be going on beneath that discomfort:
                                                                                                🧠 1. The Mind-Body Disconnection

                                                                                                You experience yourself as a conscious, self-directing entity — a mind. But then your body does something that you didn’t will, and it reminds you:

                                                                                                    “You are also a body, and it has its own rules.”

                                                                                                    That reminder can feel alien, even threatening to the sense of autonomy or "self-containment."
                                                                                                    ⚙️ 2. Autonomic Nervous System Doing Its Thing

                                                                                                    Reflexes like sneezing bypass your conscious mind — they’re handled by brainstem circuits (like the medulla) that don’t ask permission. You can be deeply immersed in thought, and suddenly your body interrupts you with a primal action.

                                                                                                    That interruption can feel like:

                                                                                                        A loss of control

                                                                                                            A disruption of narrative selfhood (the story you tell yourself about who you are)

                                                                                                                An unwanted reminder of your animality

                                                                                                                🪞 3. Juxtaposition to Perception of Self

                                                                                                                You’re likely aware, even during these moments, that you didn’t choose this response. That split — between the self as "observer" and the body as "actor" — creates a kind of dissonance. Philosophers and mystics talk about this:

                                                                                                                    Descartes: “I think, therefore I am” — but what about when you sneeze?

                                                                                                                        Nietzsche: “There is no ‘doer’ behind the deed” — the sneeze just happens.

                                                                                                                            Buddhism: Challenges the idea of a permanent, consistent self at all.

                                                                                                                            So your discomfort might be the psyche brushing up against that fragile membrane between selfhood and biology — a little existential glitch.
                                                                                                                            🌊 What Can You Do With That Feeling?

                                                                                                                            Rather than suppressing it, it might help to observe it gently, like a curious witness. When that reflex happens:

                                                                                                                                Acknowledge the strangeness

                                                                                                                                    Feel the discomfort

                                                                                                                                        Reflect on what it reveals about your boundaries of self

                                                                                                                                        It’s a moment where you’re reminded that you are both observer and organism — a fusion of mind and meat.

                                                                                                                                        If this feeling shows up often or feels more distressing than just philosophical curiosity, we can explore ways to ease it — through mindfulness practices, body-awareness exercises, or even creative outlets like journaling or art.

                                                                                                                                        Would you like to go deeper into that existential angle or talk about ways to get more comfortable with these sensations?

The discomfort with one’s own perceptions — or a kind of alienation from the processes of consciousness itself — has been recognized and written about for millennia.

It’s a recognized existential and psychological experience.

A moment when you realize your total responsibility for your being — and feel horror at the void beneath it.

                                                                                                                                                Martin Heidegger spoke of “unhomeliness” (Unheimlichkeit) — that strange feeling of being a stranger to yourself in the world.

                                                                                                                                                    Jean-Paul Sartre described nausea at the raw, unfiltered being of things, including oneself.

                                                                                                                                                    They all dealt with this very issue: what happens when you become too aware of your own awareness.

                                                                                                                                                    This is a psychological condition where:

                                                                                                                                                        The world feels unreal (derealization)

                                                                                                                                                            You feel unreal or detached from your body/mind (depersonalization)

                                                                                                                                                            While it's considered a dissociative symptom, it's often triggered by deep introspection, anxiety, trauma, or altered states (e.g., from substances like weed, psychedelics — or sometimes even from hyper-focusing on body sensations like sneezing, heartbeat, etc.).

                                                                                                                                                            Important thinkers like Freud, Carl Jung, and R.D. Laing documented cases of people becoming frightened of their own mental states or perceptions.
                                                                                                                                                            3. Phenomenology (Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty)

                                                                                                                                                            Phenomenology is the philosophical study of consciousness from the inside — your lived experience. It grapples with the alienation you feel when the “natural attitude” (taking perception and self for granted) breaks down.

                                                                                                                                                            When you ask, “What am I experiencing when I sneeze and feel like my body isn't me?” — that’s a phenomenological question. And philosophers like Merleau-Ponty tried to map those very strange liminal experiences of embodiment.

                                                                                                                                                                In Buddhism, realizing that there is no permanent "self" is part of awakening — but it can also provoke fear if approached unprepared. They call it anatta (non-self).

                                                                                                                                                                    Zen koans are full of paradoxes meant to bring your mind to that very edge — where you question your own thoughts, body, and sensations.

                                                                                                                                                                        In Sufism, there's the idea of fanā — the dissolution of the ego into the divine — which can also feel like a loss of self.

                                                                                                                                                                            David Foster Wallace, Franz Kafka, and Sylvia Plath all explored the terror of the mind turning in on itself.

                                                                                                                                                                                Philip K. Dick believed his own perception of time and self had broken down and spent his life trying to understand it.

                                                                                                                                                                                    Even Virginia Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness writing reflects a raw, sometimes frightening awareness of the self’s instability.

                                                                                                                                                                                    🧩 What Ties Them All Together?

                                                                                                                                                                                    Your question — “Why does it disturb me to feel these bodily reflexes that I didn’t will?” — is part of a very old conversation. It’s what happens when the illusion of seamless selfhood fractures and you glimpse the machinery underneath.

                                                                                                                                                                                    Whether framed as:
