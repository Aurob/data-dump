"solitude bestows an increase in something valuable ... my perception. But ... when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. There was no audience, no one to perform for ... To put it romantically, I was completely free" - Christopher Thomas Knight

daily distractions can catalyze a quest for more
significant and lasting contributions to one's life
and to the wider world, turning temporary voids
into opportunities for profound engagement and
reflection.
