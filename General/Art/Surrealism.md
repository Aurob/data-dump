`McLuhan pointed to the` `[light bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_bulb)` `as an example. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence".``[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media\#cite_note-1)`
