That feeling when one is bored and we start cycling through the same distractions we have done in times past to simply do something. Feels like we're looping and all one can think about is what will they do for the rest of the day, until they fall asleep again. Intoxication seems to be the most favorable distractant.
no matter how insightful and profound they feel, its not about those solitary moments of intense eternal introspection, because they provide no value to the endless moments of boredom that bridges their flare ups. In those "local eternities" the only thing one can even do is try to shift the feeling, like struggling in a riptide, lest they release and let the tide take over. But unfortunately the self-conscious is the hope that a lifeguard in the form of simply time passing will come, a lucid panic attack where the best-case scenario is deep introspection into the nature of ones existence and the deterministic nature of ones actions.
Distraction is the solution. The very basis of being conscious is that they experience every moment and can subdivide their agency into infinitesimal pieces, but when not distracted it festers in local eternities of a kind of  degrading bliss.
