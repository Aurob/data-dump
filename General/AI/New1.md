AI response for writing like the story "Nausea" by Sarte:

"Nausea" dives into feelings of discomfort and confusion that arise when you suddenly see life in a raw, unfiltered way. The main character, Roquentin, realizes that the world doesn't come with ready-made meanings or purposes. This realization feels unsettling and makes everyday objects and experiences appear strange or even repulsive.

If you're new to writing, you can explore these ideas by creating characters who confront the unexpected or unfamiliar sides of their lives. You could write a story where someone questions their routine existence or discovers that what they thought was certain is now questionable. Use vivid descriptions to convey how this shift in perception feels—maybe the way a room changes when seen in a different light or how a familiar routine becomes daunting.

These concepts are relatable in new stories because they deal with universal human experiences: questioning one’s place in the world, seeking meaning, and the discomfort of confronting the unknown. Such themes can create compelling narratives that resonate with readers on a deep, introspective level.

Write something that challenges readers to consider the constructs of identity and reality, something that presents a raw depiction of existential angst and self-discovery.
