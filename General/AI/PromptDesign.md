Framework Behind Novel Prompts

There is an underlying framework, though it’s often intuitive. Here’s how it works:

1. Contradictions & Paradoxes: Start with something fundamental and twist it (e.g., "What if time flowed backward?").


2. Anthropomorphism: Attribute human-like qualities to non-human things (e.g., "If gravity had feelings, what would they be?").


3. World-Building Thought Experiments: Ask “What if?” about societal, physical, or philosophical changes (e.g., "What if morality had to be quantified?").


4. Constraints & Inversions: Add odd constraints to known systems (e.g., "What if languages couldn’t describe reality?").


5. Cross-Domain Blending: Combine unrelated concepts (e.g., "What if music were governed by laws of physics we haven’t discovered yet?").
