Need to cleanup my monthly subscriptions
Need to cleanup my cloud-presence
 - Cloudflare
 - AWS
 - Hivelocity
 - Wasabi
 - Azure dev
 - Fastly
 - Sourcehut
 - Google? Apple?
 - Other:
   - SDF/freeshell/neocities/other

Need to reconsider selfhosting options
 currently:
  - VPS for general development/tests
  - cloudflare workers for more "stable" cloud projects
  - github actions for some projects
  - sourcehut builds for others
  - Storage with R2 and Wasabi, but largely unused
 new idea:
  - scrap VPS entirely in favor of 100% local-selfhosting
    - ie run my personal website like I do now with the VPS, but from my home network.
      - use a pi, or get a dedicated box
  - still use things like cloud workers/edge and storages
