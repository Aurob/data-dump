Create a note taking/journal system that will be accessable via web for ease of input/edit.
Set something up that will then take all the notes and package them into a GBA ROM and make the ROM accessable for easy download.
Then I can download the ROM and load onto an actual GBA cart and play on a real GBA to read all my notes/journals.
Add a web-based GBA emulator so the same ROM can be ran on a webpage.
