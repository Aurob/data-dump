Use IRC and an IRC Bot as input for an API that has access to data.

Connect the IRC bot to a cloudflare worker with some AI feature: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/
connect it to a database, or a web scraper, or an image generator, etc..

Idea, when you need to make a reminder, log on to the IRC channel #reminders wherever you can and just type a time and the content and the IRC bot will store it and send a push notification to all shared devices
