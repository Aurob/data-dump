I want to explore a project around serendipity.
maybe a kind of content aggregate.
allows for ubiquitous note-taking/documenting habits.
as bare-bones a solution as I can, maybe everything will be stored as files on a computer.
eliminate as many dependencies as possible, while also attempting to keep setup as simple as possible.

I'm thinking 2 kinds of content:

1. notes
    1. markdown
    2. plain text
2. Personal
    1. Anything I make myself
        1. code
            1. HTML/JS
            2. Python scripts
            3. shell scripts
            4. server configs (setup scripts, docker, install list, etcâ€¦)
    2. External copies
        1. Basically any kind of external content that I save
            1. PDF
            2. datasets
            3. codebases/repos
3. External
    
    1. Data that comes from live content on the web
        1. API
        2. scraping
        3. live links
    2. AI generated
        1. Text
        2. Images
        3. Sounds
