Below is an overview of how each of these concepts—Garbage Can Model, Satisficing, Bounded Rationality, and Soft Computing—could apply to your minimalist, file-based aggregator project. These ideas can help you design features and workflows that embrace uncertainty, encourage serendipitous discovery, and make practical (rather than overly “perfect”) use of information.

1. Garbage Can Model
What It Is
Originating in organizational theory, the Garbage Can Model describes decision-making in an environment characterized by ambiguity, fluid participation, and shifting preferences.
In this model, decisions happen somewhat unpredictably when four elements “collide” in the same “garbage can”: problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities.
Why It Matters Here
Your aggregator can be seen as a “garbage can,” where you toss in different files, notes, links, code snippets, and random inspirations over time.
Serendipity (the “unexpected discovery”) is a core feature you want to enable. Embracing the garbage can idea means you let “messiness” happen intentionally instead of rigidly curating or over-organizing.
The model suggests that interesting, creative ideas can emerge simply by virtue of having a diversity of “problems” and “solutions” in one place—so your aggregator should make it easy to store and recall anything.
Implementation Ideas
Loose Linking, Quick Capture: Encourage users to throw data in quickly (minimal friction). Detailed curation can come later, if at all.
Random Surfacing: By randomly pulling or surfacing older or tangentially related files, you let “unconnected” problems and solutions bump into each other (echoing the “collisions” in the garbage can model).
Scheduled or Triggered “Collisions”: Automate occasional “prompting,” e.g., “Here’s a random PDF from 2020; does it spark any connection to your current project?”
2. Satisficing
What It Is
Satisficing is a decision-making strategy that aims for a “good enough” rather than an optimal solution.
Coined by Herbert A. Simon, it recognizes that perfectly evaluating all options is impossible or prohibitively expensive (time, effort, resources).
Why It Matters Here
Your aggregator is designed to be minimalist and unopinionated. You likely don’t want to build a massive, complex AI-driven system that attempts to deliver perfect search results or perfect link suggestions.
Instead, a simpler system that returns “good enough” outcomes—fast—may encourage people to keep using it and capturing data. This helps maintain a flow state of note-taking and discovery.
Implementation Ideas
Lightweight Search/Indexing: Tools like ripgrep or fzf might be “good enough” for most immediate needs; if you want more advanced indexing, you could integrate something like lunr.js or a local search engine optionally, rather than mandating it.
Incremental Improvements: Start with simple text-based or filename-based searches, and only integrate more advanced features if you find real friction.
Focus on Speed & Accessibility: A quick but partial match is more likely to keep users engaged than an elaborate search that requires heavy indexing or bulky dependencies.
3. Bounded Rationality
What It Is
Also introduced by Herbert A. Simon, Bounded Rationality acknowledges that humans have limited cognitive resources, incomplete information, and finite time. We can’t always make fully rational decisions.
Why It Matters Here
Your aggregator’s users (including you) will frequently operate under time constraints and incomplete understanding of all that’s stored.
Encouraging “enough is enough” decisions and not overwhelming the user with an excess of organizational overhead might keep the aggregator intuitive.
Because we can’t fully predict the future utility of each piece of information, the aggregator should remain flexible and low-friction.
Implementation Ideas
Minimal Folder Hierarchies: Offer a sensible default structure that covers broad categories (e.g., notes/, projects/, assets/, clippings/), rather than forcing hyper-specific subfolders.
Reduced Overhead: Let people search or randomly browse instead of pushing them to meticulously tag or refile everything.
Contextual Help: Small hints or a built-in short tutorial that surfaces relevant “best practices” only when the user needs them, instead of large comprehensive guides.
4. Soft Computing
What It Is
Soft Computing covers approximate, heuristic, or non-exact methods like fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and neural networks. It aims to handle imprecision or uncertainty in real-world problems.
Compared to “hard computing,” it tolerates partial truths and approximations, often providing workable results faster.
Why It Matters Here
Your aggregator might handle messy, unstructured data—snippets of text, PDFs, incomplete code, random references.
Using soft computing approaches might allow you to build “smart” recommendation or classification features without requiring perfect structure or labeling.
These techniques can surface unexpected links, provide rough similarity matches between notes, or do light semantic analysis (e.g., using a local embeddings model) to relate new content to older notes.
Implementation Ideas
Fuzzy Searching & Similarity: Instead of exact matches, use fuzzy matching for note or file retrieval (e.g., fzf or custom Python scripts that leverage approximate string matching).
Semantic Embeddings: If you integrate a local language model or a small embeddings approach (like sentence-transformers), you could show related notes or files even if they don’t share explicit keywords.
Approximate Clustering: Group your data by topic area or semantic similarity once in a while, to see potential new cross-links or dormant materials worth revisiting.
Putting It All Together
embrace the mess (Garbage Can Model) while still providing just enough structure to keep things navigable (Satisficing & Bounded Rationality).
surface randomness to allow creative collisions and new insights (Garbage Can Model, Soft Computing), using minimal but “good enough” search or fuzzy matching (Satisficing, Soft Computing).
stay flexible about how much you formalize or index your data (Bounded Rationality & Satisficing).
sprinkle in low-overhead heuristics (Soft Computing) for advanced features like semantic similarity or fuzzy grouping—only as optional, plugin-like enhancements.
The overarching theme is to keep the aggregator simple, robust, and serendipitous. By applying these concepts, you can systematically invite the chaos of creative discovery while still offering enough structure for quick retrieval and lightweight organization.
