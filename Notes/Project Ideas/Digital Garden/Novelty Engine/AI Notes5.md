Initial Problem: You have a large collection of Wikipedia links with associated tags and descriptions. You need an interface that allows for both casual browsing and focused learning. Existing interfaces like simple lists, cards, and grids feel inadequate for your needs, especially regarding non-scrolling interaction and a desire for artistic, non-goal-oriented views.
Key Requirements:
 * Non-Scrolling Interaction: Avoiding endless scrolling is crucial.
 * Intuitive Exploration: The interface should encourage discovery and connection-making.
 * Dual Purpose: Serve both casual browsing/artistic visualization and focused learning with spaced repetition.
 * Personal Focus: The interface is for your personal use, not for a wider audience.
Interface Ideas (Focusing on Non-Scrolling):
 * Interactive Table: A sortable, filterable table with columns for title, description, and tags (displayed as chips).
 * Tiled Layout with Zoom: A grid of small tiles representing articles, allowing zooming for more detail.
 * Categorized Tabular Layout: Grouping articles into broader categories, then using tables within each category.
 * Carousel with Filtering (Multi-Slot): A carousel with multiple visible slots, updated by filtering.
 * "Focus" View: Highlighting articles related to a selected article based on shared tags.
 * Tag-Based Grouping with Drill-Down: Clicking on tags reveals associated articles.
 * Customizable "Dashboard": Pinning favorite articles or tag groups for quick access.
Artistic/Non-Functional Visualizations (Static, No Interaction):
 * Color-Coded Timeline: Articles arranged chronologically, with colors representing tags.
 * Tag-Based Mosaic: A grid where cell colors represent dominant tags.
 * Abstract "Constellation" Map: Points of light representing articles, proximity based on shared tags.
 * "Encoded" Text Wall: Stylized short representations of articles forming a textured visual.
 * Metaphorical Physical Sculpture/Rendering: Representing tags as different materials in a sculpture.
 * Soundscape: Assigning sounds to tags and "playing" them based on tag distribution.
 * "Data Painting": Algorithmically generated abstract images based on article data.
 * "Woven" Visualization: Tags as colored threads woven into a tapestry.
Missing Data for Enhanced Functionality:
 * Article importance/popularity
 * Creation/edit dates
 * Geographic data (if applicable)
 * Image URLs/thumbnails
 * Semantic relationships (beyond tags)
 * Article length
 * Hierarchical tagging
 * Customizable metadata
 * Pre-computed "related articles" data
 * Summarized text/abstracts
 * Emotional tone/sentiment
 * Key concepts/entities extracted from text
Spaced Repetition Integration (The End Goal):
 * Focusing on key concepts/facts rather than whole articles.
 * Using tags as review categories.
 * Varying review methods (summarizing, mind mapping).
 * Using a difficulty rating system.
 * Creating a "review queue" visualization.
 * Implementation options range from simple spreadsheets to custom scripts/programs, integration with existing software (like Anki), or a dedicated web app/browser extension.
Overall Goal: To create an interface that allows you to both explore your Wikipedia collection in a visually engaging and artistic way and to effectively learn and retain information through spaced repetition. The interface should facilitate the selection of what to learn and provide a visually appealing overview of the entire collection.
