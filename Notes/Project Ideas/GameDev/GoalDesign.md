A goal, or quest, or purpose, or drive, or whatever, a "telos"
 - telos has been consistently used in the writings of Aristotle, in which the term, on several occasions, denotes 'goal'.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/9042015403]

Thinking of it like a hike
You can hike to point A then back to point B
or you can hike to point B and stay there, or go on to a point C
A to B can be a loop, so that B is also A
These can be like out-and-back trails or like a loop
out-and-back you always return the same way you came
loop is a different point all the way from A to B
