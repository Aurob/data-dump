Game Story Concept
 - Ringworld-style structures that make up a system of cylindrical space habitats
 - Player controls an "AI" that monitors this system
   - inspiration is like the forerunner monitors from Halo, the Minds from the Culture, and the natural self-sustaining nature of large-scale ringworlds from Ringworld

Scene opens up on a serene vista, centered on the player.
The player controls an avatar that is physically on one of the rings, but the actual embodiment of the players character in-themselves is on a scale comparable to the volume of a stellar nebula.
A message/notification appears
 - something like 'routine checkup, return to core'
   - where 'core' is like the main overview of the entire game map consisting of all the rings in the cylinder system
 - some kind of snarky remark about it from the players character
   - player dialogue will be 'first-person' style, no choices
These checkups occur roughly every 1/2.5/5/10/50/100/1000 increment spans
 - for each ring slice that is, some rings could have daily checks, some only 1000
The story checkup is on a 10 year increment
 - "year" to be roughly understood as an Earth year, but in-game might use term "cycle"
   - where 1 "cycle" is based on the rotation speed and angle of each ring
   - i.e, 1 cycle on a slow ring might be 10 years on an earth-derived rotating ring, but only 1 day on that have a ring with a much higher rotation speed

The character was essentially enjoying a 10 year vacation
 - now they must run through a checklist for each of the rings with 10 year checkup cycles
 - most are minor automated/background checks that occur constantly
