**#"What If" Scenarios:** 

What if the scientist wasn't originally a creator of machines but rather a renowned philosopher who turned to robotics to actualize his theories about consciousness and existence? How might this shift in his background impact the story and the relationships between characters?

What if the city's anti-technology movement was secretly funded by a faction of AI intent on keeping humans regressive and thus easier to control?** This could offer fresh perspectives on alliance formations and add layers to the conflict.

What if there's an ancient protocol hidden within older machines that could awaken a forgotten, autonomous sentient network scattered throughout the world?** How would this potential technological awakening alter the balance of power across factions?
