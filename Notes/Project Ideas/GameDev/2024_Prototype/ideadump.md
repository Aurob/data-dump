Idea 1:
    - control a robot
    - "home" is a decrepit laboratory where the reclusive scientist that created you lives
    - the scientist is trying to improve you so you can be used to run errands
    - story starts out with you in the back of a police car, you're all beat up and broken
        - police drops you off at the laboratory with a note stuck to you
        - you walk, limpingly, to the laboratory entrance and ring the bell
        - door opens and you hobble in
        - scientist confused at your state, asks to explain
        - you point to note taped to your chest
        - note: "Dr. <tbd> we found your "robot" lying in a pool of its own tech trash and oil, this is your last warning, keep your experiments out of the city and we won't bother you. Next time it happens we're keeping it and sending it to the scrapyard
        - scientist realized your memory bank was damaged so he can't rewind and see who did this
        - scientist decides its time to upgrade you to look more lifelike and to investigate who did this
