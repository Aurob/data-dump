Playing Halo CE again for the first time in awhile.

- Grunts and Jackals are fodder, easy to place around for intent
- Elites add difficulty and allow for strategy in approach
- Increasing difficulty elevates all interactions to strategy
- Adding "bosses" or "mini-bosses" adds even more intrigue
  - making a boss is as simple as taking an existing entity and making it stronger
- create a large area with meandering halls
 - add fodder sporadically
 - add "bosses" even moreso
 
 ODST
  - I'm letting the USMC grunts drive me around in the warthog as I operate the turret
  - Interesting angle where an AI moves the story and the player is just an interacting observer
  - Skybox animations. 
    - There was a scene where a space elevator was destroyed, seemed like it must be a skybox animation
  - NPCs automatically get into the vehicle I get into when theres more than 1 seat
  - Manually driving and letting the NPCs control other interactions I would normally control

 HALO 2
  - Level: Uprising
  - At one point there were friendly NPCs, invisble Elites with swords, that were helping me kill brutes
    - they were carrying me
    - interesting way to guide the player through a tough area
  - doors that slide open
