Playing Halo CE again for the first time in awhile.

- Grunts and Jackals are fodder, easy to place around for intent
- Elites add difficulty and allow for strategy in approach
- Increasing difficulty elevates all interactions to strategy
- Adding "bosses" or "mini-bosses" adds even more intrigue
  - making a boss is as simple as taking an existing entity and making it stronger
- create a large area with meandering halls
 - add fodder sporadically
 - add "bosses" even moreso
