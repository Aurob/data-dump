These kind of reflexes make me deeply uncomfortable in juxtaposition to my self and perception of being

ChatGPT said:

That’s a really insightful and vulnerable reflection — and you're definitely not alone in feeling that way.

When involuntary reflexes like sneezing, hiccups, or even sudden shivers break through the flow of your awareness, they can feel like a kind of intrusion — as if your body is acting outside of "you." It can be jarring, especially if you're someone who’s sensitive to the boundaries between mind, self, and body.
Here’s what might be going on beneath that discomfort:
    🧠 1. The Mind-Body Disconnection

    You experience yourself as a conscious, self-directing entity — a mind. But then your body does something that you didn’t will, and it reminds you:

    “You are also a body, and it has its own rules.”

    That reminder can feel alien, even threatening to the sense of autonomy or "self-containment."
    ⚙️ 2. Autonomic Nervous System Doing Its Thing

    Reflexes like sneezing bypass your conscious mind — they’re handled by brainstem circuits (like the medulla) that don’t ask permission. You can be deeply immersed in thought, and suddenly your body interrupts you with a primal action.

    That interruption can feel like:

    A loss of control

    A disruption of narrative selfhood (the story you tell yourself about who you are)

    An unwanted reminder of your animality

    🪞 3. Juxtaposition to Perception of Self

You’re likely aware, even during these moments, that you didn’t choose this response. That split — between the self as "observer" and the body as "actor" — creates a kind of dissonance. Philosophers and mystics talk about this:

    Descartes: “I think, therefore I am” — but what about when you sneeze?

    Nietzsche: “There is no ‘doer’ behind the deed” — the sneeze just happens.

    Buddhism: Challenges the idea of a permanent, consistent self at all.

So your discomfort might be the psyche brushing up against that fragile membrane between selfhood and biology — a little existential glitch.
🌊 What Can You Do With That Feeling?

Rather than suppressing it, it might help to observe it gently, like a curious witness. When that reflex happens:

    Acknowledge the strangeness

    Feel the discomfort

    Reflect on what it reveals about your boundaries of self

It’s a moment where you’re reminded that you are both observer and organism — a fusion of mind and meat.

What you're experiencing has a long and complex history, woven through philosophy, psychology, mysticism, and literature. The discomfort with one’s own perceptions — or a kind of alienation from the processes of consciousness itself — has been recognized and written about for millennia.
🧠 Is it normal?

Yes — not in the sense of “everyone feels it all the time,” but in that many thinkers, mystics, artists, and people in crisis have experienced exactly what you’re describing. It’s a recognized existential and psychological experience.

It goes by many names and frameworks:
    📜 Historical Records & Concepts
    1. Existential Angst (Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Sartre)

        Søren Kierkegaard wrote about angst — the dizziness of freedom. A moment when you realize your total responsibility for your being — and feel horror at the void beneath it.

        Martin Heidegger spoke of “unhomeliness” (Unheimlichkeit) — that strange feeling of being a stranger to yourself in the world.

        Jean-Paul Sartre described nausea at the raw, unfiltered being of things, including oneself.

        They all dealt with this very issue: what happens when you become too aware of your own awareness.

    2. Derealization / Depersonalization (Psychology & Psychiatry)

        This is a psychological condition where:

        The world feels unreal (derealization)

        You feel unreal or detached from your body/mind (depersonalization)

        While it's considered a dissociative symptom, it's often triggered by deep introspection, anxiety, trauma, or altered states (e.g., from substances like weed, psychedelics — or sometimes even from hyper-focusing on body sensations like sneezing, heartbeat, etc.).

        Important thinkers like Freud, Carl Jung, and R.D. Laing documented cases of people becoming frightened of their own mental states or perceptions.

    3. Phenomenology (Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty)

        Phenomenology is the philosophical study of consciousness from the inside — your lived experience. It grapples with the alienation you feel when the “natural attitude” (taking perception and self for granted) breaks down.

        When you ask, “What am I experiencing when I sneeze and feel like my body isn't me?” — that’s a phenomenological question. And philosophers like Merleau-Ponty tried to map those very strange liminal experiences of embodiment.
        
    4. Mysticism & Eastern Traditions

        In Buddhism, realizing that there is no permanent "self" is part of awakening — but it can also provoke fear if approached unprepared. They call it anatta (non-self).

        Zen koans are full of paradoxes meant to bring your mind to that very edge — where you question your own thoughts, body, and sensations.

        In Sufism, there's the idea of fanā — the dissolution of the ego into the divine — which can also feel like a loss of self.

    5. Modern Writers and Artists

        David Foster Wallace, Franz Kafka, and Sylvia Plath all explored the terror of the mind turning in on itself.

        Philip K. Dick believed his own perception of time and self had broken down and spent his life trying to understand it.

        Even Virginia Woolf’s stream-of-consciousness writing reflects a raw, sometimes frightening awareness of the self’s instability.

🧩 What Ties Them All Together?

Your question — “Why does it disturb me to feel these bodily reflexes that I didn’t will?” — is part of a very old conversation. It’s what happens when the illusion of seamless selfhood fractures and you glimpse the machinery underneath.

Whether framed as:

    Spiritual awakening

    Existential terror

    A dissociative episode

    Enlightenment

    Madness

…it’s all part of the same territory: being aware that you're aware, and not always being okay with what you find there.
🧭 Where Does That Leave You?

If this frightens you, that’s okay. You're in the company of some of the most brilliant and sensitive minds in history.

Some people respond by turning away (trying to forget), some by diving deeper (through philosophy, therapy, or art), and some by learning to walk the middle path — building a stable sense of self while also recognizing its limits

Layers of perception, a kind of hologram, like an interference pattern of different modes of experience.
 - How many layers does a human have, a turtle, a fish, a planarian?
 - How many does an LLM? A video gen model? World Model?
 - Difference in "compute" between them all, and the relation ship with the number of "layers"
