"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination - What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth - whether it existed before or not." -Keates

[“That is the key. If you know there is a way out, you can focus on what life has to offer. You can balance the pain and suffering because if it gets to that point, you can end it.”](

Words falter. A whisper to the void. Letting go, he drifts into the unknown.
The last entry waits unwritten, the pen rests as silence speaks the final word.

"solitude bestows an increase in something valuable ... my perception. But ... when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. There was no audience, no one to perform for ... To put it romantically, I was completely free" - Christopher Thomas Knight

the ephemerality of daily distractions can catalyze a quest for more significant and lasting contributions to one's life and to the wider world, turning temporary voids into opportunities for profound engagement and reflection.

Beware beautiful nonsense mistaken for deep truth.

sketches serve as a bridge between pure thought and realized creation - they're both a record of thinking and a springboard for future development. They capture the moment of potential, when an idea could evolve in countless directions.

Wabi-sabi is a beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. It is a beauty of things modest and humble. It is a beauty of things unconventional. ... delicate traces, faint evidence, at the borders of nothingness. 
Things wabi-sabi often appear odd, misshapen, awkward, or what many people would consider ugly. They are appreciated only during direct contact and use; they are never locked away in a museum. They have no need for the reassurance of status or the validation of market culture. They have no need for documentation of provenance. 
Wabi-sabi-ness in no way depends on knowledge of the creator's background or personality. In fact, it is best if the creator is of no distinction, invisible, or anonymous. 
Wabi-sabi comes in an infinite spectrum of grays: gray-blue brown, silver-red grayish black, indigo yellowish-green ... and browns: blackish deep brown-tinged blue, muted greens. And blacks: red black, blue black, brown black, green black.
