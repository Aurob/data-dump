According to their unconscious-thought theory, conscious thought is adept at analytic and derivative processing that primarily isolates and discriminates, but unconscious thought excels at integrating and associating information and is capable of carrying out associative searches across a broad range of background knowledge (Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006). When Dijksterhuis and Meurs asked participants to generate new names for products, participants who were distracted for a number of minutes generated more names that diverged from the examples given than did participants who consciously thought about the task for an equal duration, even though the two groups did not differ in the total number of names they generated. Unconscious thought appeared to change the very nature of the search process.
